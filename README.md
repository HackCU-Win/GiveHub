## Inspiration
Most charity platforms use social media to promote giving.  We flipped that around and integrated charitable donations into Twitter.

## How it works
Tweet @ a charity signed up with us using a dollar amount and #GivingWithGiveHub.  A ReTweet allows a friend to donate just as easily.
We will perform natural language processing on your tweet and will tweet you a URL to donate directly to the organization.

Example: Thanks @RedCross for all you do - I am #GivingWithGiveHub an amount of $27.

## What's next for GiveHub
Simplicity of donation - remembering users/confirming transactions through wearables.  Forming a strong social media presence and growing with charities.
